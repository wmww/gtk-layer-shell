/**
 * SECTION:gtk-layer-shell
 * @title: Gtk Layer Shell
 * @short_description: A library to write GTK Applications using Layer Shell
 *
 * There is also a [version of this library compatible with GTK4](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell/)
 *
 * # Forcing Window Size
 * If you wish to force your layer surface window to be a different size than it
 * is by default:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   gtk_widget_set_size_request (GTK_WIDGET (layer_gtk_window), width, height);
 *   // force the window to resize to the new request
 *   gtk_window_resize (layer_gtk_window, 1, 1);
 * ]|
 * If width or height is -1, the default is used for that axis. If the window is
 * anchored to opposite edges of the output (see gtk_layer_set_anchor ()), the 
 * size request is ignored. If you later wish to use the default window size,
 * simply repeat the two calls but with both width and height as -1.
